# Yo, I'm Flood! 👋
### 21 y/o Computer Engineering Student @ CIU | Founder of [FloodTechLab](https://floodtechlab.com) 🚀

I'm Furkan. I've been glued to PCs since I was born. My journey started with video games the moment my hands touched a keyboard, which naturally evolved into a curiosity for **how things work**.

By middle school, I was already messing around with Arduino and coding, turning that gamer energy into a builder mindset. Now, as a first-year Computer Engineering student, I'm building tools that I would actually use myself.

When I'm not debugging code or soldering, you can find me riding my motorcycle or grinding in competitive shooters.
